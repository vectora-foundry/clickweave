# Workflow Execution (Reference)

The engine provides two execution modes: **workflow executor** (deterministic replay of node graphs) and **agent loop** (goal-driven autonomous execution).

## Workflow Executor

The deterministic executor runs a pre-built workflow graph sequentially, dispatching each node to MCP tools.

### Entry Point

Execution starts at Tauri command `run_workflow` (`src-tauri/src/commands/executor.rs`), which creates `WorkflowExecutor` and calls `run()`.

### Execution Flow

1. Emit `StateChanged(Running)`
2. Spawn MCP client subprocess
3. Walk the graph from entry point, executing each node in sequence
4. For each node: resolve target, call MCP tool, record trace events
5. In Test mode: run supervision verification after action nodes
6. Emit `StateChanged(Idle)` when complete or cancelled

### Key Structures

- `WorkflowExecutor` — owns the workflow graph, MCP client, LLM backends, and execution state
- `RetryContext` — per-run transient state (supervision hints, retry tracking, verdicts)
- `DecisionCache` — persisted LLM decisions from Test mode, replayed in Run mode
- `RunStorage` — manages trace event files and artifacts per execution

### State & Contracts

Executor-owned state relevant for CDP and focus bookkeeping:

- `cdp_connected_app: Option<(String, i32)>` — name and PID of the app the CDP session is currently bound to. Comparing both fields (not name only) prevents the CDP connection from silently targeting a different instance of a same-name browser.
- `focused_app: RwLock<Option<(String, AppKind, i32)>>` — last-known focused app with its kind classification and PID. Used by deterministic dispatch to pick the CDP path for Electron/Chrome apps.

`RetryContext` (per-run, transient):

- `completed_node_ids: Vec<(Uuid, String)>` — each entry pairs the node id with its sanitized auto-id prefix, so rollback can also remove any variables the node produced.
- `force_resolve: bool` — skip the persistent decision cache on the next resolution (set after an eviction so retry doesn't replay a stale decision); reset when a node succeeds.
- `focus_dirty: bool` — set when an AI step calls a focus-changing MCP tool (`launch_app`, `focus_window`, `quit_app`); consumed by post-step logic to refresh `focused_app`.

`StepOutcome` (private to `run_loop`) — includes a `Cancelled` variant so a cancellation-token trip during a node is propagated explicitly instead of falling through as a generic failure.

Supervision is **fail-closed**: backend errors during verification are treated as `passed = false`. A broken verifier must not silently pass a bad step.

### Execution Modes

- **Test mode**: Interactive. Runs supervision verification, records decisions to cache, supports retry/skip/abort.
- **Run mode**: Headless replay. Reads cached decisions, skips supervision.

## Agent Loop

The agent loop (`crates/clickweave-engine/src/agent/`) is a goal-driven observe-act loop. It is the primary LLM-driven execution path in Clickweave — the user types a natural-language goal and the agent emits one MCP tool call per step until the goal is reached.

### Entry Point

Tauri command `run_agent` (`src-tauri/src/commands/agent.rs`) creates an `AgentRunner` and starts the loop. The command accepts an `AgentRunRequest { goal, agent, project_path, workflow_name, workflow_id }` where `agent` is the LLM endpoint used for decisions.

### Loop Structure

Implemented in `crates/clickweave-engine/src/agent/loop_runner.rs`:

1. **Observe**: Gather page elements from the current app (via CDP when available; native tools otherwise).
2. **Cache check**: Look up the observation in the per-run decision cache. On a hit the cached tool call is replayed after re-approval.
3. **Decide**: The agent LLM receives the conversation so far — system prompt, goal, prior steps and tool results, plus the full MCP tool list (augmented with `agent_done` and `agent_replan`) — and returns exactly one tool call.
4. **Approve** (optional): If the approval gate is attached, the UI can approve or reject each tool call before dispatch. Pre-approved tool categories skip the prompt.
5. **Act**: Dispatch the chosen MCP tool and record the result.
6. **Append**: Persist the emitted tool call as a workflow node and an edge from the previous step, so the run materializes as a linear workflow.
7. **Compact**: Run context compaction on the transcript, including snapshot supersession — older AX/DOM snapshots collapse to short placeholders while the most recent snapshot per tool stays at full fidelity (see `crates/clickweave-engine/src/agent/context.rs`). Step summaries are collapsed once the transcript exceeds the token budget.
8. Repeat until `agent_done`, `agent_replan` (replan terminates the run with a divergence summary for the variant index), max steps, max consecutive errors, or user cancellation.

### Caching

Decisions are cached in an `AgentCache` keyed by goal + observed element signature. Entries are persisted to `agent_cache.json` in the run storage directory so a future run against the same app state can replay the decision without an LLM round-trip. Approval-gated tools are re-approved on replay. Observation-only tools (e.g., `take_screenshot`, `take_ax_snapshot`) are never cached.

### Events

The loop emits events through an `AgentChannels` mpsc channel, forwarded as Tauri events by `commands/agent.rs`:

- `agent://started` — run started; carries the generation `run_id`
- `agent://step` — tool call completed successfully
- `agent://step_failed` — tool call returned an error
- `agent://node_added` / `agent://edge_added` — workflow persistence
- `agent://approval_required` — approval gate is waiting on the UI
- `agent://cdp_connected` — CDP auto-connect succeeded
- `agent://sub_action` — automatic pre/post-tool hook ran (e.g., auto CDP connect)
- `agent://warning` / `agent://error`
- `agent://complete` — goal achieved; summary in payload
- `agent://stopped` — bounded exit (max_steps, max_errors_reached, approval_unavailable, cancelled)

All payloads carry the `run_id` so stale events from a prior run can be filtered on the UI side.

### Operator Controls

- `stop_agent` — cancels the running loop; sends an explicit rejection through any pending approval so the engine returns `Ok(false)` instead of "approval unavailable".
- `approve_agent_action { approved: bool }` — responds to the current pending approval.
